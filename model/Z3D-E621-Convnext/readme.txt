The e621 model is uploaded at https://discord.gg/BDFpq9Yb7K ("The Gooey Pack")
This is terrible for preservation and accessibility, but github has a filesize limit, so you need to download it separately.
You can find the model in the "other-models" forum, in the "[WIP] E621 Convnext Image tagger." post.
Put the model.onnx and tags_selected.csv files next to this text file.

It's also a goo and latex fetish server, so if you're into that then go to town.
