The e621 model is uploaded at https://discord.gg/BDFpq9Yb7K ("The Gooey Pack")
This is terrible for preservation and accessibility, so if you don't want to bother, just stick with the model already here.
Otherwise, you can find the model in the "other-models" forum, in the "[WIP] E621 Convnext Image tagger." post.
It's also a goo and latex fetish server, so if you're into that then go to town.
